## v0.9.21** - 2015 October 24
- Don't JSON stringify `$.failure()` and `$.success()` responses because `$.end()` does it too

## v0.9.19 - v0.9.20** - 2015 October 23
- Fixed a https bug in host.js - if the port was undefined in the header it used 80. For https it should be 443. Now it's using the server's configuration to choose a default fallback protocol.

- Chainable Server Instance Creation, Listening and Routing. Now you can do stuff like:
```
server()
	.listen(8000)

	.get('/other', function($){ $.end('hello other world') });
	.missing(function($){ $.end('404 :)') });
```
- Fixed bugs with `$.end`

## v0.9.8 - **v0.9.16** - 2015 June - October
- `$.end()` now serves JSON responses on requests where the `"x-requested-with"` == `"XMLHttpRequest"` or the `"Authorization"` header is set and contains `"Bearer"` or `"Token"` in it's value
- `$.end()` now accepts JSON objects as a value and sends it as a JSON response
- app.html now enables $.html as the default response when using $.end
- Added `$.html()` - by default it just sets the content-header to html - to ovewrite it set a handler for `$.htmlModule (input)` in your diet header modules 
- Bug Fixes

- Treat localhost addresses equally (127.0.0.1, 192.168.99.100, localhost)
- Listen on multiple addresses without redirects or host configs

## v0.9.3 - 2015 May
- The body for POST and PUT methods now require the appropriate "Content-Type" header to be parsed. For URL encoded body "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" is required, for JSON requests "application/json". If no "Content-Type" is specified then $.body contains the raw body content.

## v0.9.2 - 2015 February
